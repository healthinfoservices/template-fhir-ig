## Implementation Guide Template for Australian Context

### Overview

This Implementation Guide (IG) is built from a GitHub template for creating an IG for new FHIR project.  This version includes dependencies on the Australian FHIR standards - AU Base (v5.0.0) and AU Core (v1.0.0).   A version of the same template without jurisdiction specific dependencies is in process for those outside of Australia.

### Interoperability & Architecture

This Implementation Guide describes a set of base FHIR profiles for interoperability/data exchange between systems operating in  the Australian context. To modify these from the generic AU Core/AU Base profiles,  you will need to edit the .fsh files in the /input/fsh folder.

### Example Profiles

Simple example profiles are included for the following resources:

* Patient (AUTmpPatient)
* Practitioner (AUTmpPractitioner)
