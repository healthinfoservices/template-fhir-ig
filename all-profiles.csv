It is acknowledged that many clinicians might not be in a position to distinguish the mechanism of a particular reaction. Often the term ""allergy"" is used rather generically and may overlap with the use of ""intolerance"" - in practice the boundaries between these two concepts might not be well-defined or understood. This data element is included nevertheless, because many legacy systems have captured this attribute. Immunologic testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis of the reaction and the causative substance, but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for sensitivity to a particular substance.

","A record of medication being taken by a patient in an Australian healthcare context","A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.   A MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future.  The source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The medication information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains. 

The primary difference between a medication statement and a medication administration is that the medication administration has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the person who administered the medication.  A medication statement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the medication statement information may come from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.","When interpreting a medicationStatement, the value of the status and NotTaken needed to be considered:MedicationStatement.status + MedicationStatement.wasNotTakenStatus=Active + NotTaken=T = Not currently takingStatus=Completed + NotTaken=T = Not taken in the pastStatus=Intended + NotTaken=T = No intention of takingStatus=Active + NotTaken=F = Taking, but not as prescribedStatus=Active + NotTaken=F = TakingStatus=Intended +NotTaken= F = Will be taking (not started)Status=Completed + NotTaken=F = Taken in pastStatus=In Error + NotTaken=N/A = In Error.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"MedicationStatement",0,*,"","dom-2:If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT contain nested Resources {contained.contained.empty()}

","Extensions that cannot be ignored even if unrecognized","May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the element and that modifies the understanding of the element in which it is contained and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).","There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.","Modifier extensions allow for extensions that *cannot* be safely ignored to be clearly distinguished from the vast majority of extensions which can be safely ignored.  This promotes interoperability by eliminating the need for implementers to prohibit the presence of extensions. For further information, see the [definition of modifier extensions](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility.html#modifierExtension).","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"BackboneElement.modifierExtension",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
